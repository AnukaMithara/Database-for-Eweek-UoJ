1. High Level Problem Summary       
    E-week has many events. So, we need to keep a record of all those events. It is necessary to select winning teams, the best players, the best performers, and so on. This database management system will be developed to keep complete activity records easily.
    The primary success criteria for this project are managing event details and keeping students constantly updated on E-Week event details at our university.
    It is essential for university students to know exactly what their batch is achieving at a big event like E-Week. So, we need to keep records of match details, time, winning teams, points scored, etc. There is an E-Week exhibition also, but this project mainly focuses on sports events.


2. Detailed Problem Statement

    2.1 FUNCTION             
            It is essential to inform the players in advance of big events like E-week, update the match details frequently, ensure the students receive the information quickly, and calculate points for final scores.
            This system helps organizers to keep records and calculate scores easily, and students can quickly find out what happens during an event.

    2.2 TIME               
            In past E-weeks, reporting has been done using paper or spreadsheets. Students were kept updated by updating notice boards or social media. So, this system is the best way to keep the records and update the students.
            E-week organizers can handle the system, and we can put an admin for each event. Users can see the past event details.
            In the future, the system is expected to be developed to be more user-friendly. It can also be used for exhibition. This can be developed to target not only university students but also others who want to know about university.
